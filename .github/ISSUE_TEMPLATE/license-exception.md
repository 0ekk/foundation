For all license exception requests, we need the following information in order to help make a decision to grant an exception.
- [ ] What is the alternative license?
- [ ] If this is newly created code, why can't it be under Apache-2.0? 
- [ ] Is this an existing 3rd party open source project?
- [ ] How does this code integrate with or interact with, if at all, other components of CNCF? 
- [ ] How will the code be maintained? Who is responsible? 
- [ ] How will the code be kept up to date with security patches?
