For all license exception requests, we need the following information in order to help make a decision to grant an exception.
- [ ] What is the third party component (name, URL, and version if available)?
- [ ] What license(s) is it provided under?
- [ ] If it is Apache-2.0 for code or CC-BY-4.0 for documentation, no further exception request is required.
- [ ] Does it meet the Allowlist policy? If so, no further exception request is required.
- [ ] Will the code be used in modified or unmodified form? 
- [ ] If modified, will changes be contributed back to the upstream project?
- [ ] Are there any alternative components available with equivalent functionality under a more permissive license? 
- [ ] If so, is it possible to use that component instead?
- [ ] How does this component integrate with or interact with, if at all, other components of the project?"
